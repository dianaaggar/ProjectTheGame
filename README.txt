The game involves flipping face-down cards on a grid, with hidden an image. 
The player selects two cards to flip,  If the images on the two flipped cards match, 
the player finds a pair. If not, the player has to try again.

The game continues until all cards are face-up, with the goal being to match all pairs 
in as few moves as possible.
 Once all pairs are matched, a "Congratulations! You matched all the cards!" message is displayed.
